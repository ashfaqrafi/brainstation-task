          for a patient, or if a patient comes to you to ask about the option of
          a clinical trial, you can help by providing them with a range of
          different types of support throughout the clinical trial journey.

                            If it is deemed suitable to progress to the next
                            stage, the patient will meet with the trial
                            coordinator. It is only then, and after a number of
                            tests have taken place, that the decision will be
                            made as to whether the patient can enter the
                            clinical trial. It is important to reassure patients
                            that you will still play an active role in their
                            care and are likely to have more consultations while
                            they are taking part in a trial.
